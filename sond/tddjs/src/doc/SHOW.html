<h3>Showalter Index (ÂºC)</h3>

<p>
The SI is based on the properties of the 850 and 500 mb levels. The SI is calculated 
by lifting a parcel dry adiabatically from 850 mb to its LCL, then moist adiabatically 
to 500 mb, and comparing the parcel versus environmental 500 mb temperatures similar 
to the LI. The SI may be better than the LI in showing instability aloft given a 
shallow low-level cool airmass north of a frontal boundary. However, the SI is an 
unrepresentative index and inferior to the LI in showing instability if the low-level 
moisture does not extend up to the 850 mb level.

$$ Showalter Index = T_{env} - T_{parcel} $$
